# Runesong

This is a WIP grid-based colony builder game that utilizes Unity's new Data-Oriented Tech Stack for higher performance. It's like RimWorld in a fantasy medieval world with pixel graphics, with less focus on micromanaging the needs of characters, and more focus on diplomacy, politics, and developing history in a randomly generated world. I'm taking inspiration from Crusader Kings and RimWorld to create great emergent storytelling. 

"Runesong" is a placeholder name. I thought a norse sounding title looked nice. I might change it, or might not. 

This is WIP and not even close to complete. I've only implemented the multithreaded A* pathfinding, and will need to upgrade this to HPA*.
